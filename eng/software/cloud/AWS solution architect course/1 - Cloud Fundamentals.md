##### Cloud Computing Definition:
1. **On-Demand Self-service** - Provision and terminate using a UI/CLI w/o human interaction
2. **Broad Network Access** - access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods (https, vpn, ssh)
3. **Resource Pooling** - economies of scale, cheaper service, resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
4. **Rapid Elasticity** - scale up (out) and down (in) automatically in response to system load
5. **Measured Service** - usage is measured, pay for what you consume
###### Application/Infrastructure Stack
1. Facilities
2. Infrastructure
3. Servers
4. Virtualization
5. O/S
6. Container
7. Runtime
8. Data
9. Application
Varying levels of management
##### Types of Cloud service models: 
**Infra-as-a-service**
- consume the O/S and anything above
- pay per second/hour you use the O/S
- can only use the VM sizes the provider allows, but cheaper
- e.g. AWS EC2
**Platform-as-a-service**
- aimed at developers, e.g. you have an app and want to run it somewhere
- e.g. Heroku
**Software-as-a-service**
- consume the app, e.g. using netflix, gmail
