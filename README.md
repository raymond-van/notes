A collection of curated notes on topics I'm learning (or reviewing). Mostly STEM topics for now. 

Starting this repo because:
- Writing my own notes combined with some retention strategy (e.g.: Anki) will make me a better, more knowledgeable developer. 
- Having a weak foundation makes it harder to grasp advanced concepts
- Learning new things has never been easier with LLMs (AI rocks ðŸ˜Ž)
